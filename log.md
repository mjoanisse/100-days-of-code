# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Thursday, January 19

**Today's Progress:** I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Not until after the fact did I realize coding exercises did not count towards this challenge. I'm going to make the call and still count as a legitimate completed day 1 of my 100 day challenge. **Come on, throw me a bone here!**

### Day 2: Friday, January 20

**Today's Progress:** Still racing through some already familiar subjects on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Coding on a Friday night after coding at work all day when you've just inherited the office bug going around, I'll take a rain check, thanks. I must say though, it feels somewhat justifiable to blame yesterday's lack of commitment and a distraught attitude to my immense displeasure in watching Trump's pathetic swearing in and the humiliating ball performances that followed later that night. Nonetheless, no excuses. Only logged ~ 30 minutes yesterday. Slip up on day 2 of 100, great start!

### Day 3: Saturday, January 21

**Today's Progress:** Still sifting through HTML and CSS roadmap.

**Thoughts:** Back in the sack! Finally into the js realm now (at least), hoping to get cracking on a project within the next couple of days. General project concept idea is there, only thing left to do is start. Maybe tomorrow?
