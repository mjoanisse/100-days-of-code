# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Thursday, January 19

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Not until after the fact did I realize coding exercises did not count towards this challenge. I'm going to make the call and still count as a legitimate completed day 1 of my 100 day challenge. **Come on, throw me a bone here!**
